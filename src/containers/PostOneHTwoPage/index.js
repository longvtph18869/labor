                            <p>Entilators will be taken from certain New York hospitals and redistributed to the
                                worst-hit parts of the state under an order to be signed by Governor Andrew Cuomo.
                                <br/>
                                <br/>New York saw its highest single-day increase in deaths, up by 562 to 2,935 -
                                nearly half of all virus-related US deaths recorded yesterday. The White
                                House may advise those in virus hotspots to wear face coverings in public to
                                help stem the spread.\<br/><br/>The US now has 245,658 Covid-19 cases.<br/><br/>A
                                shortage of several hundred ventilators in New York City, the epicentre of the outbreak
                                in the US, prompted Mr Cuomo to say that he will order the machines be taken from
                                various parts of the state and give them to harder-hit areas.<br/><br/>Amid a deepening
                                crisis, top health official <span className="bold"> Dr Anthony Fauci</span> has said
                                he believes all states should issue stay-at-home
                                orders.
                                <br/>
                                <br/>“I don’t understand why that’s not
                                happening,” Dr Fauci told CNN on Thursday.
                                “If you look at what’s going on in this
                                country, I just don’t understand why we’re
                                not do ingthat.”

                                consistently dismissed the notion of a nationwide lockdown.
                                <br/>
                                <br/>“It’s awfully tough to say, ‘close it down.’ We have to have a little bit of
                                flexibility,” Mr Trump said on Wednesday.</p>

                            <p>Both the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO)
                                are reassessing their guidance on face masks, as experts race to find ways to fight
                                the highly contagious virus.

                                <br/>Covid-19 is carried in airborne droplets from people coughing or sneezing,
                                but there is some dispute over how far people should distance themselves
                                from each other, and whether masks are useful when used by the public.</p>
                            <div className="space-40"/>
                            <div className="row">

                                <div className="col-md-6">
                                    <p>The WHO advises that ordinary face masks are only effective if combined with
                                        careful hand-washing and social-distancing, and so far it does not recommend
                                        them generally for healthy people.
                                        <br/>
                                        <br/>However, More and more health experts now say there are benefits.
                                        They argue that the public use of masks can primarily help by
                                        preventing asymptomatic patients - people who have been infected
                                        with Covid-19 but are not aware, and not displaying any symptoms -
                                        from unknowingly spreading the virus to others.</p>

                            <p>Masks may also help lower the risk of individuals catching the virus through the
                                droplets from another person’s sneeze or a cough - and people can be taught how put
                                masks on and take them off correctly, they argue.
                                <br/>
                                <br/>On Thursday New York mayor Bill de Blasio urged all New Yorkers to cover
                                their faces when outside and near others, but not to use surgical masks,
                                which are in short supply.
                                <br/>
                                <br/>“It could be a scarf. It could be something you create yourself at
                                home. It could be a bandana,” he said. Governor Cuomo weighed in on
                                Friday, saying “i think it’s fair to say that the masks couldn’t
                                hurt unless they gave you a false sense of security.”

                                <br/>Meanwhile, residents in Laredo, Texas will now face a $1,000
